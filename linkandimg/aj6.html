	<p>	The Air Jordan VI had a new design by Tinker Hatfield and released in 1991. The Original 5 colorways were: Black/Infrared, White/Infrared, White/ Carmine-Black, White/Sport Blue, and Off White/Maroon. The Air Jordan VI introduced a reinforcement around the toe, It had two holes in the tongue, and a molded heel tab on the back of the sneaker (demanded by Jordan so it wouldn't hit his Achilles tendon). Like the Air Jordan V this sneaker also had Clear rubber/"Icy" Soles. The Air Jordan VI was the last Air Jordan to feature the Nike Air logo on it.<br/>

Later that year the Bulls defeated the Lakers in the 1991 NBA Finals, with Jordan (wearing the Black/Infrared) named as the most valuable player. That was also the first NBA Championship won by Jordan and the Bulls. The Jordan VI was also seen in the film White Men Can't Jump, which was produced in 1991 and released one year later.<br/>

The Air Jordan VI has been retro-ed many times since its original release in 1991, Notable releases were in 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014 with the Black Infrared Colorway.<br/>

In addition to a Porsche-inspired rear pull tab and visible air the Air Jordan VI was the first Jordan with an inner bootie.<br/>

The Air Jordan VI was originally released in 1991. It was retro-ed in 2000, 2002, 2006, 2008–2010, 2012 and 2014–2017.<br/>

The Air Jordan VI saw much of screen time in 2015's Creed. Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) can be seen sporting the black/infrared and the white/varsity red-black colorway through most of the movie,[10] most notably during the training montage before the big fight that Rocky films are known for.<br/>

The VI was the first shoe used by the protagonist of Slam Dunk, Hanamichi Sakuragi.[12] Nike released special versions of both the VI and the Jordan Super.Fly 3 featuring artwork from the series in 2014. The VI also had Sakuragi's number 10 embroidered on the side of the heels.[13] Various other models in the Air Jordan line are featured in the series, including the original (which Sakuragi eventually switched to), the V, and the XII (both worn by Sakuragi's rival, Kaede Rukawa)<br/>
