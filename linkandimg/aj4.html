		n 1989, Nike released the Air Jordan IV to the public. Designed by Tinker Hatfield, it was the first Air Jordan released on the global market. It had four colorways: White/ Black-Cement Grey, Black/Cement Grey, White/Fire Red-Black, and Off White/Military Blue.<br/>

Nike featured director and actor Spike Lee in ads for AJ IV. Lee had featured the shoe in his movie Do The Right Thing. The Air Jordan Bordeaux "Spiz'ike IV" was made to commemorate Lee's friendship with Michael Jordan.<br/>

The Air Jordan IV was on Jordan's feet when he made "The Shot," a series winner in Game 5 of the 1989 NBA First Round between the Chicago Bulls and the Cleveland Cavaliers. In 2012 a Cavalier colorway dubbed the "Cavs" was released to honor "The Shot."<br/>

The Air Jordan IV was re-released in 1999 and retroed in 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010–2013 and 2015–2018. Recent retroed colorways are the Retro 4 "Legend Blue", "Oreo" in early 2015, and the Retro 4 OG "Cement" that released on February 13, 2016. </p>
