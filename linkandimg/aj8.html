	<p>The Air Jordan VIII was released to coincide with the 1992–1993 NBA season. The eighth model of the Air Jordan was noticeably heavier than its predecessors. This shoe had a lot more detail than most of the earlier Air Jordans such as two crossover straps on each shoe and a Jumpman. Thus the Air Jordan VIII model became known as the "Punisher" because of the advanced basketball ankle support and enhanced traction. This shoe contains a full length air sole, polyurethane midsole, polycarbonate shank plate, and two crossover straps (for added support and more custom fit).<br/>

The Air Jordan VIII was originally released in 1993. It was retro-ed in 2003, 2007, 2008, 2013 and 2015–2017</p>
